<h2>Our objectives</h2>
<p>
Our goal is to help researchers across college become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions. </p>

<p>This two day course is aimed at UCL postgraduate students and research staff who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively. </p>

<h2> Setup </h2>
<p>You are required to bring your own laptop to the course.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>
<p> Please note that this bootcamp is restricted to the UCL staff and postgraduate students only.</p>
